Q1=> Explain redux to a 5 year old (ELI5) ?
Ans=> Redux is like a store that you can use anyhwere you want and you can also store stuff there.

Q2=> What is immutability?
Ans=> Immutability means not capable of or susceptible to change.

Q3=> What does Object.freeze() do?
Ans=> A frozen object can no longer be changed; freezing an object prevents new properties from being added
        to it, existing properties from being removed, prevents changing the enumerability, configurability, 
        or writability of existing properties, and prevents the values of existing properties from being changed.

Q4=> Why is immutability required by Redux?
Ans=> Immutability of redux state is necessary since it allows detecting redux state changes in an efficient manner.

Q5=> How does Redux use shallow equality checking? 
Ans=>1. creates a reference to the current state slice referred to by each key;
     2. calls the appropriate reducer and passes it the slice;
     3. creates a reference to the possibly-mutated state slice that's returned by the reducer.

Q6=> How well does Redux “scale” in terms of performance and architecture?
Ans=> React Redux in particular is heavily optimized to cut down on unnecessary re-renders, and React-Redux v5 shows 
      noticeable improvements over earlier versions. Redux may not be as efficient out of the box when compared to other libraries.

Q7=> How does Redux compare to the React Context API?
Ans=> Both are excellent tools for their own specific niche, Redux is overkill just to pass data from parent to child & Context API truly shines in this case. 

Q8=> What is webpack ?
Ans=> webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling

Q9=> What is treeshaking ?
Ans=>  Tree shaking is a term commonly used within a JavaScript context to describe the removal of dead code.

Q10=> What are some features of using webpack?
Ans=> 1. Entry. Webpack creates a graph of all of your application's dependencies. ...
      2. Output. Once you've bundled all of your assets together, we still need to tell Webpack where to bundle our application. ...
      3. Loaders. ...
      4.Plugins.

Q11->What does React.memo mean?    
Ans-> React.memo is a higher order component. If your component renders the same result given the same props, you can wrap it in a call to React. memo for a performance boost in some cases by memoizing the result.  

Q12-> What is flux architecture?
Ans-> Flux is the application architecture that Facebook uses for building client-side web applications. It complements React's composable view components by utilizing a unidirectional data flow.

Q13-> What are Controlled and Uncontrolled components?
Ans-> Controlled component is component that get the changed value from the callback function and uncontrolled component is component that have the one from the DOM. For example, When input value is changed,we can use onChange function in Controlled Component and also we can get the value using DOM like ref.

Q14-> What is Higher-order Components?
Ans-> A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic.

Q15-> What are keys in React? Why are keys important?
Ans-> Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

Q16-> What is reconciliation?
Ans-> React provides a declarative API so that you don't have to worry about exactly what changes on every update.
